==================================================
	---- Nessus ----


Nessus:
-Used for automated testing to find a vulnerability given an IP Address
-uses a web GUI

Command to start it:
service nessusd start

Nessus port, it will be listening here (this is how you access the web GUI):
https://127.0.0.1:8834

==================================================
	---- NMap scripting engine ----


NMap scripting engine:
-helpful for manual checks to verify results from vulnerability scanners (such as Nessus)
-to look for vulnerabilities not found from the scanners

all scripts can be found here:
/usr/share/nmap/scripts

Commands:
nmap --script-help [category]

nmap -sC [TargetIPAddress] -oA [fileName] 	
->Performs a script scan using the default set of scripts. It is equivalent to  --script=default. 
Some of the scripts in this category are considered intrusive and should not be run 
against a target network without permission.

===================================================
		---- Metasploit ----


Starting it up:
service postgresql start ---> start up the postgresql server, Metasploit uses PostgreSQL as its database so it needs to be launched first
service metasploit start --->  start up metasploit
msfconsole   ---> runs the program

In Metasploit:
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous
msf > show options
msf > set RHOST [TargetIPAddress]
msf > run
msf > check	--->determines if target is vulnerable
msf > exit

====================================================
		---- Web Access XAMPP ----

Possible points of access:
[ipAddress]/webdav
[ipAddress]/tomcat
[ipAddress]/phpmyadmin
[ipAddress]/X

WebDav Vulnerability:
-check if xampp contains webdav by going to link: [ipAddress]/webdav
-webdav can be exploited using cadaver
-xampp is php based, payloads should be in php

e.g.
cadaver [ipAddress]/webdav
>username: wampp
>password: xampp


-check if xampp contains login: [ipAddress]/phpmyadmin


How to find points of access through automation (Brute-Force):
-using dirbuster (includes a GUI interface)
-usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/director0list-1.0.txt  to access a list of possible default words to use for the wordlist
dirbuster
->Target URL = [IPAdress]

Alternative to dirbuster, using Nikto:
nikto -h [IPAdress]
